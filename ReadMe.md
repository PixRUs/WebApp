PIX is a web application designed to connect sports pick sellers and buyers. The platform facilitates transparent and trustworthy transactions, ensuring sellers and buyers engage in a fair and reliable marketplace.

We want to create a platform that offers transparency and accountability between sports pick sellers online. Our platform will allow users to access data-driven insights, track the performance of different sellers, and make informed decisions based on accurate information. Additionally, we will implement a rating and review system for pick sellers to ensure that only those with proven track records can thrive, ultimately protecting users from deceptive practices and enhancing their betting experience.

We want to build our web application using Django and implement our database with MongoDB. Our goal is to create a scalable website capable of handling a large number of users while continuously fetching real-time updates on current odds and book spreads. By leveraging Django's robust framework and MongoDB's flexibility, we aim to ensure our platform is both reliable and efficient, providing users with up-to-the-minute data.

An important aspect of our website is to have a modern and sleek design, ensuring that the user interface is intuitive and easy to navigate. While the front end will be simple and user-friendly, the back end will feature complex and robust functionality to handle the demands of real-time data processing and large-scale user interactions. Our goal is to create a seamless experience where the sophistication of the backend technology supports a clean, straightforward user experience.

Our most important goal for this project is to create a long-term platform that we will continue to maintain and enhance beyond this course. This semester, our primary objective is to develop a production-level product with limited functionality and capabilities. As we continue to learn and familiarize ourselves with new topics, we plan to gradually expand the platform's features, incorporating advanced technologies such as LLMs and AI functionalities. 

Main features of the web application. 
 - Provide a user feed with past bets and status of bet (Win / Lose) with original odds
 - Provide sellers with a “Rating” based on successful placed bets
 - Provide buyers with picks synchronized with real-time books.


Testing:
-	We would release our application in beta allowing all picks to be seen for free and only allow a group of approved beta testers to populate our application with their picks.
